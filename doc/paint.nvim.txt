1. Paint                                                    *paint.nvim-paint*

Simple Neovim plugin to easily add additional highlights to your buffers.

See the `@something` comments in the screenshot. Those are not coming from the
`comment` **Treesitter** parser.

WHY?                                                         *paint.nvim-why?*

The reason I implemented this is because of the slow performance of
tree-sitter-comment <https://github.com/stsewd/tree-sitter-comment> in large
files. **Treesitter** will inject the `comment` language for every line
comment, which is far from ideal. Iâ€™ve disabled the `comment` parser, but
still wanted to see `@something` highlighted in Lua comments.

REQUIREMENTS                                         *paint.nvim-requirements*

INSTALLATION                                         *paint.nvim-installation*

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

>
    -- Packer
    use({
      "folke/paint.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("paint").setup({
          ---@type PaintHighlight[]
          highlights = {
            {
              -- filter can be a table of buffer options that should match,
              -- or a function called with buf as param that should return true.
              -- The example below will paint @something in comments with Constant
              filter = { filetype = "lua" },
              pattern = "%s%-%-%-%s(@%w+)",
              hl = "Constant",
            },
          },
        })
      end,
    })
